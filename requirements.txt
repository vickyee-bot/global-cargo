Global Cargo Shipping Management System
Internship Project No. 3
15-JULY-2025
System Description
The Global Cargo Shipping Management System is a comprehensive maritime logistics management
platform designed to facilitate, track, and optimize the shipping of cargo across continents via registered
vessels. The system brings together multiple components of maritime cargo logistics—clients, cargo,
ships, crew, and shipments—into a single, integrated solution that enhances operational efficiency,
improves visibility, and supports business scalability.
A. Ship Registration and Tracking
- Register ships with details like name, type, registration number, and cargo capacity.
-Track the current ship location by port or coordinates.
- Assign ship statuses: Active, Under Maintenance, or Decommissioned.
B. Crew Management
- Add and manage crew members with role, nationality, and contact details.
- Assign each crew member to a ship and use is_active to manage active/inactive crew.
C. Client Management
- Register client companies with contact person, email, phone, and address.
- View cargo owned by each client and enable/disable clients using the is_active flag.
D. Cargo Management
- Create and manage cargo records with description, weight, volume, and type.
- Link cargo to its respective client and track whether the cargo is active or archived.
E. Shipment Management
- Schedule cargo shipments by selecting ship, cargo, origin port, and destination port.
- Record departure, estimated arrival, and actual arrival dates.
- Set and track shipment status: Pending, In Transit, Delivered, or Delayed.
- Manage shipment lifecycle using the is_active flag.

User Stories
User stories help clearly define software requirements from the end-user's perspective, ensuring the
product delivers real value. Below is a set of user stories to guide development, organized by user roles
and features. These will help you understand the system’s functionality from an end-user perspective.
1. Ship Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Add a new ship so that I can expand the company’s fleet.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (name, registration_number, capacity) and optional
fields (type, status). Registration numbers must be unique.
Edit an existing ship so that I can correct details or update status.
- Acceptance Criteria: Changes to registration_number re-check uniqueness. Status updates (e.g., "under
maintenance") trigger alerts to logistics team.
View all ships so that I can monitor fleet capacity.
- Acceptance Criteria: Paginated list with filters by type (cargo/passenger), status (active/maintenance),
and sort by capacity.
Decommission a ship so that outdated vessels are removed from active service.
- Acceptance Criteria: Toggle `is_active` flag; decommissioned ships don’t appear in shipment
assignment dropdowns.
2. Crew Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Add a new crew member so that I can staff our ships.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (first_name, last_name, role, phone_number) and
optional field (nationality). Phone numbers must be unique.
Edit a crew member's details so that I can keep records up-to-date.
- Acceptance Criteria: Role changes trigger validation (e.g., only one Captain per ship). Phone number
changes preserve uniqueness.
View all crew members so that I can manage staffing.
- Acceptance Criteria: Paginated list with filters by role, ship assignment, and status. Sort by last name or
join date.
Deactivate a crew member so that former employees are removed from active duty.
- Acceptance Criteria: Toggle `is_active` flag; inactive crew don't appear in assignment lists but retain
historical records.
3. Ports Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Add a new port so that we can expand shipping routes.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (name, country, coordinates) and optional fields
(docking_capacity, customs_authorized). Port names must be unique per country.
Edit port details so that information stays current.
- Acceptance Criteria: Coordinate changes validate proper lat/long format. Capacity updates warn if
below largest ship's requirements.
View all ports so that I can plan logistics.
- Acceptance Criteria: Map and list views with filters by country, port_type, and customs status. Sort by
name or docking capacity.
Archive a port so that inactive ports don't appear in new shipments.
- Acceptance Criteria: Toggle `is_active` flag; archived ports remain visible in historical shipment data.
4. Cargo Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Register new cargo so that items can be shipped.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (description, weight, client_id) and optional fields
(volume, cargo_type). Weight must be >0.
Edit cargo details so that records stay accurate.
- Acceptance Criteria: Cargo_type changes from 'dangerous' trigger safety protocol confirmations. Client
changes preserve shipment history.
View all cargo so that I can track inventory.
- Acceptance Criteria: Filter by client, cargo_type, and status. Sort by weight or registration date.
Dangerous cargo highlighted.
Deactivate cargo records so that shipped items don't clutter active lists.
- Acceptance Criteria: Toggle `is_active` flag; inactive cargo remains linked to completed shipments.
5. Shipments Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Create a new shipment so that cargo can be transported.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (cargo_id, ship_id, origin/destination ports,
departure_date). Validates ship capacity vs cargo weight.
Update shipment status so that progress is tracked.
- Acceptance Criteria: Status changes follow workflow rules (e.g., can't mark 'delivered' before
departure). Delays require reason notes.
View all shipments so that I can monitor operations.
- Acceptance Criteria: Timeline and list views with filters by status, date range, and ports. Sort by
departure or estimated arrival.
Cancel a shipment so that errors can be rectified.
- Acceptance Criteria: Sets status to 'cancelled' with mandatory reason field. Notifies affected clients and
crew.
6. Clients Management
As an Admin, I want to...
Add a new client so that we can manage their shipments.
- Acceptance Criteria: Form with required fields (first_name, last_name) and optional fields (email,
phone). Email must be unique if provided.
Edit client information so that contact details stay current.
- Acceptance Criteria: Email changes re-check uniqueness. Address updates don't affect existing
shipments.
View all clients so that I can manage relationships.
- Acceptance Criteria: Search by name, filter by activity status. Sort by last interaction date or total
shipments.
Deactivate a client so that inactive accounts don't appear in new orders.
- Acceptance Criteria: Toggle `is_active` flag; preserves all historical shipment data.
