## 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION

### Business Problem
Maritime shipping companies face complex operational challenges in managing their fleets, crew, cargo, and logistics operations. Key problems include:

- **Fleet Management Inefficiencies**: Lack of real-time visibility into ship status, utilization rates, and maintenance schedules
- **Fragmented Data**: Information scattered across multiple systems making decision-making slow and error-prone
- **Resource Allocation**: Difficulty in optimizing crew assignments and fleet deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Limited insights into route efficiency, port performance, and operational bottlenecks
- **Manual Processes**: Time-consuming manual tracking of shipments, cargo, and client relationships

### Business Impact
- Increased operational costs due to inefficient resource utilization
- Delayed decision-making affecting customer satisfaction
- Compliance risks from inadequate record-keeping
- Lost revenue from suboptimal route planning and fleet utilization
